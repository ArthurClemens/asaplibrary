# ASAP Library - ActionScript library for creating Flash applications

ActionScript 3.0 Application library for the development of maintainable, multi-movie, interactive applications. Provides practical, reusable, pattern-based solutions for common challenges in Flash applications.

This project was in active development between 2004 and 2011. Currently no one writes applications in Flash anymore, right?


## Introduction

ASAP Library is a loose collection of useful patterns. You may find a couple of things in it that makes your work easier, as these are solutions for problems we have encountered ourselves more than once.


## History

Before ASAP Library there was ASAP Framework. And before that, a collection of ActionScript patterns grown with a couple of colleagues at Lost Boys Amsterdam.
